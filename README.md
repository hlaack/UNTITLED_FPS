This is a solo endeavor into creating a fun and interactive boomer-shooter inspired by the originals like Doom and Quake, with a more modern inspiration of Ultrakill, etc.

This is done in Godot 4.4+ and is developed at a hobby-pace, despite wishing I had more time to invest into it.

Follow this repository to track where I am.
